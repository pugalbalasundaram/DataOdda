This project integrates GAN and YOLO for intelligent surveillance anomaly detection. GAN learns normal activity patterns, while YOLO detects and tracks objects in real-time. Deviations between predicted and actual scenes signal anomalies, enhancing security accuracy, reducing false alarms, and enabling automated monitoring.
